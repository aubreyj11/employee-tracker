## Description
This project is designed to allow a user to be able to not only create but also keep track of tables of all employees, managers, and departments that a company might have. I built this application to make organizing a team easier for any user who may need it. It solves the problem of worrying about where to keep all information of employees and creates a database with all the information for easy access.

## Installation
Inquirer version 8.2.4 must be installed for this application to work as well as MySql and the console table.
