## Description
This project is designed to allow a user to be able to not only create but also keep track of tables of all employees, managers, and departments that a company might have. I built this application to make organizing a team easier for any user who may need it. It solves the problem of worrying about where to keep all information of employees and creates a database with all the information for easy access.

## Installation
Inquirer version 8.2.4 must be installed for this application to work as well as MySql and the console table.

## Usage
After making sure all dependencies are installed, run 'node server.js' and prompts will appear. It will be connected to the database used to keep track of the employees, roles, and departments. Click on the option you would like to do (ex. View All Departments) and you will be given the means to complete that option.
